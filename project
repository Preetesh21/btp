As part of the internship project modules
1. Random data generation for unique user count (meaningful dataset generation)
- Well distributed users in the dataset
- Skewed user dataset
- other dataset that can be useful

2. HLL algorithm (either using the spark exposed interface, defining the HLL using TPL discussed here https://mungingdata.com/apache-spark/hyperloglog-count-distinct/ ). Define HLL algorithm UDAF, accumulator

3. Define Map Accumulator for unique user counting
- define the internal datastructure to store the data and expose only the count to the user

4. Have the main class defined which takes input like the type of algorithm to use to calculate unique user counts (2 or 3)

5. well established test suite having unit tests covering all the scenarios
